# Git as a version management system.

## Pros
This system allows for management of files which is helpful if you are working with large projects or need to share files.

Helpful in manuscript writing or proposals for research grants. You can easily track the changes.

## Cons
A little challenging to setup and understand how to properly use it. Overall, not a huge learning curve.

Large files are an issue with Git. 

Little confusing on remembering where committs are in the pipeline

## Looking Forward
I think Git will be easier for me to use once I start using it on a more frequent basis. 

My current challenges can be resolved by pratice and the use of class material.
